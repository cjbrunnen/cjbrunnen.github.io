  <h1 class="no-top-margin"> My Expertise </h1>
  <p> 
    I'm an experienced Junior-Intermediate Frontend developer. My expertise spans a range of front-end frameworks including React, Typescript, Redux, MaterialUI, and Gatsby on the frontend, and Node, Meteor and MongoDB for full-stack development. 
    <br>
    I've worked in both agency and product-based companies, utilising Agile methodologies and SCRUM practices.
    I'm a natural-born problem solver and I have a creative mind, making me a resilient and patient programmer. 
    <br>
    I have a strong work ethic and well thought out workflow.
    I'm passionate about how emerging technology can change our lives for good
    Tech plays a huge role in a user's end experience and I'm proud to be the one behind the scenes, making it all happen.  </p>
