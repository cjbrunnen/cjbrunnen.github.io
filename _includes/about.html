  <h1 class="no-top-margin"> My Expertise </h1>
  <p> I'm a junior/mid-weight developer based in Sydney. My previous roles include a year as a front-end developer and, more recently, a year full stack. I've worked in both agency and product-based companies, utilising Agile methodologies and scrum practices.

    I'm a natural-born problem solver and I have a creative mind, making me a resilient and patient programmer. I have a strong work ethic and well thought out workflow.
          
    Tech plays a huge role in a user's end experience and I'm proud to be the one behind the scenes, making it all happen.  </p>
